# Chromie

Chromie is a tool made to inspect passed Raid fight and try to figure :
- Why it didn't work
- Planify your Raid CDs
- Get some stats on your pulls

## Objectives on short/mid term
- Clean the code (because it was a 8 hours POC and I was learning how Electron works at the same time)
- Setup a CI/CD env on Travis
- Update the "Project" part of the repo to have a view on planned functionality and setup a roadmap
