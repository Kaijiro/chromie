# Chromie

Chromie is a tool made to inspect passed Raid fight and try to figure :
- Why it didn't work
- Planify your Raid CDs
- Get some stats on your pulls

## Objectives on short/mid term
- Clean the code (because it was a 8 hours POC and I was learning how Electron works at the same time)
- Setup a CI/CD env on Travis with tests

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Run the project 
```
yarn electron:serve
```

### Run the tests
```
yarn test:unit
```
(Add `:watch` to enter watch mode)

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn lint
```
